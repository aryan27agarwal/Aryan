  October is a month of celebrations. It is a month which fills our hearts and spirit with goodness and joy.
  What
  better than celebrating this month with fun, fervour and creativity?<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
      Hence, Udyami Bazaar- an initiative of GD Goenka Technology Business Incubator (GDGTBI) encourages
      students to
      put on their entrepreneurial caps and display their business acumen and creativity in an atmosphere of
      fun and
      frolic. It’s a platform which promotes entrepreneurial attitude amongst students of GDGU. It also aims
      at
      honing their communication, presentation, marketing and managerial skills, giving them a true feel of
      being an
      entrepreneur.
      Udyami Bazaar has been running very successfully since 2013 and recently year has been brought under
      the
      purview of Goenka Technology Business Incubator (GDGTBI). GDTBI envisions being pre-eminent in
      fostering
      entrepreneurship driven initiatives, education and research directed towards the development of
      economies and
      societies. It strives to foster the entrepreneurial ecosystem at GDGU, and Udyami Bazaar is an
      initiative which
      drives this spirit in a festive manner.
      This year’s Udyami Bazaar, scheduled on 3rd November attracted more than 50 stalls including students
      from
      other universities as well. Some of the interesting stuff being offered in stalls were- games,
      eatables, house
      décor, garments, jewellery, self designed products, state ethnic products, cosmetics, stationary etc.
      Certificates, trophies, cash and gift hampers were awarded for most innovative marketing, most popular
      stall
      and most well managed stall. The atmosphere was quite charged up with each stall owner gearing up
      towards big
      earnings. </span></p><br>
